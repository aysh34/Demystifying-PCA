# Demystifying-PCA

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis. This repository, **Demystifying-PCA**, provides a research-driven, hands-on exploration of PCA using Jupyter Notebooks. The aim is to present both the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of PCA, making it accessible for students, researchers, and practitioners in data science and machine learning.

## Contents

- Contains a Jupyter Notebook that explain key concepts of PCA, step-by-step derivations, and illustrative examples using real dataset.

## Key Topics

- Mathematical foundations of PCA
- Geometric interpretation of principal components
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors in PCA
- Covariance matrix and data standardization
- Implementation of PCA with scikit-learnâ€™s PCA
- Applications to real-world dataset
- Visualization of high-dimensional data
